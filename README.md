#WHAT ACTUALLY IS MAPSER
Mapser is, well, a map app! But it's not just a map, it can also display weather info. The best thing about it though, is it's functionality. A regular maps 
application will likely show a bunch of useless data, amongst other stuff. Mapser doesn't. Its straight to the point concept will let users feel the
sensation of ease as they proceed to use Mapser.

#HOW TO USE MAPSER
Mapser is quite straightfoward. Just input your destination and press the Find! button. If you need any troubleshooting, tap the Troubleshoot... button on the bottom
of the screen. If you need more info on Mapser, go to https://mapser.cf

	#IF YOU HAVE THE MAPSERBOX™
	The MapserBox™ is an aid device designed for hands-free use. It's made to fit into almost any vehicle, including cars, buses, motorcycles and even bicycles!
	Before you power on the MapserBox, turn on Bluetooth on your host device(your phone). Turn on MapserBox and connect it to your phone's Bluetooth. It should
	connect without any errors. For troubleshooting visit https://mapser.cf/mapserbox

#TROUBLESHOOTING
(My Mapser Crashes!)
[Cause]
Mapser on your device may not be installed properly, or you might have installed it from a different source other than the official Mapser Site.
[Solution]
Reinstall Mapser from https://mapser.cf/downloads

(The LCD on my MapserBox shows nothing!)
[Cause]
The internal LCD connections might have been loosened, or the MapserBox's motherboard quit working.
[Solution]
Follow our repair guides on https://mapser.cf/mapserbox/repairs
Or, if you would prefer, send your MapserBox to our office stated below 

(Mapser shows werid code on screen!)
[Cause]
This is most likely caused by a server error, whether it's the Mapser's servers, the OpenWeatherMap server of the Google Maps server.
[Solution]
There's nothing the end-user(you) can do. It can only be fixed by the servers' maintainence teams.
